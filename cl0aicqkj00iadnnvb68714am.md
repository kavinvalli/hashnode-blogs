## Start a web server with Node.JS and Express

[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) are two of the most used technologies in the web development world right now. It powers some big sites like Paypal, Wall Street Journal, Shutterstock and a lot more.

Getting started with Node.JS and Express is very easy.

## Requirements
- You should have Node.JS installed for this tutorial. If not, visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the **LTS Version**. This will also install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/) which is a widely used package manager for Node.JS.
- You're also expected to have a basic knowledge of Javascript and Node.JS.

## Creating a project
First, let's start off with creating a Node.JS project/directory. You can run the following two commands on the the terminal. Alternatively, you can create a folder from your file manager and open it in VS Code or any other code editor of your choice. 
```sh
mkdir node-express-tutorial
cd node-express-tutorial
code . # for Visual Studio Code users
```

## Configuring the folder to use npm
Run the following in the terminal.
```sh
npm init
```
You will be prompted with a few questions. You can press enter through most of them.
> Alternatively, you can run `npm init -y` if you want to skip through all the questions with the default value.

## Starting with the coding part
So, start with creating a file named `index.js`. You can name it anything, just make sure you end it with `.js`.
> Conventionally, the file is named `index.js`, `server.js` or `app.js`.

## Installing express
Like most NodeJS packages, you can install express using npm. Run:
```sh
npm install express
```

This will add express as a **dependency** in your `package.json` and also install it in your `node_modules` folder.

## Using express
In your `index.js` file, write the following:
```js
const express = require("express")
```
If you've used Node.JS before, this should look familiar. This line basically imports the express package.
Now, to use express, you need to instantiate the imported function. So:
```diff
const express = require("express")
+const app = express()
```
Now, you can use the app variable to start the server like so:
```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server started on port 3000`)
}
```

You've basically already created a web server. You can run the app by running
```sh
node index.js
```

If you get something like in the above gif, you're good to go to the next step!

## Routes
So now, we've started an express server but it doesn't know what it has to do when we're visiting the `/` route.  Hence we get the error:

![Screenshot 2022-03-03 at 09.54.40.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646281487165/8i6yAXewV.png)

For this, add the following line of code before calling the `app.listen` function:
```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return res.send("Hello, World")
})
```
Let's go through this code:
1. We call the `app.get` function. This takes in two parameters:
    1. A route: The route on which you want to run this function. In this case we're using the `/` route.
    2. A callback function: The second parameter is a callback function with the `request` and `response` parameters which express provides us with. The `res`(response) gives us a send function with which we can send back a text response to the browser. 

Now, we need to restart the NodeJS server running. Go to the terminal where you had run `node index.js` and then hit `Control-C`. And then restart by typing `node index.js` again like so:

> BONUS: Restarting the node server repeatedly becomes very annoying. To deal with this, there's a package called `nodemon` which you can install and setup. For detailed instructions visit: https://livecode247.com/how-to-add-auto-reload-to-your-node-js-app

Now, refresh the page on the browser and you should see this:

![Screenshot 2022-03-03 at 10.08.38.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1646282325271/94UDlGOUg.png)

For the final step, you can refactor the port number like this
```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
-app.listen(3000, () => {
-    console.log(`ðŸš€ Server started on port 3000`)
-}
+app.listen(port, () => {
+  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server started on port ${port}`);
+});
```
`process.env.PORT` returns the PORT environment variable which is set in many hosting providers so it is a good practice to use that instead of hardcoding a port. We're saying that if it doesn't exist, use port 3000.

## Final Code
Your final code in `index.js` should look like this:
```diff
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  return res.send("Hello, World");
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server started on port ${port}`);
});
```

That's it for this tutorial! Now express has a lot more stuff to offer you. Just yesterday, MDN released it's new [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and I found a very good in-depth tutorial on express.
