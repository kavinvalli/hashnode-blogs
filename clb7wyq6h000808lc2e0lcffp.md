# Discord bot which shows your private Advent of Code leaderboard

It is December! That means [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is here! If you don't know what that is:

> *Advent of Code* is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as [interview](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/) [prep](https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home) [coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584) [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

## Idea Inspiration

Now, Advent of Code has two kinds of leaderboards. One is the Global Leaderboard where you're competing against the whole world and the other is Private Leaderboards. You can create Private Leaderboards for your class, your club, or a group of friends!

I am a part of a couple of Private Leaderboards and since all of us were on a discord server, I thought why not create a Discord Bot which shows the leaderboard right on the app? And so, I created [this discord bot.](https://github.com/kavinvalli/aoc-private-lb-discord-bot)
