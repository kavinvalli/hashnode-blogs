# **Here are some Visual Studio Code extension’s to make your life easier:**

1.  Live Server
    Live Server is probably one of the most important extensions and an extension when I use every time, I code in HTML and CSS. It opens up your html file in a localhost which can be helpful in accessing it from other devices in the same network.
    Not only that, it also has an auto-reload feature which reloads the page every time, you save a change in VS Code.

2.  Prettier — Code Formatter
    Prettier is an extension which helps in keeping your code clean. Even though, you can format your code using VS Code, Prettier has it’s own advantages and support for many languages

3.  Material Icon Theme
    This extension is very useful as it helps you identify files much faster by just first sight. It has hundreds of icons and they map automatically to a file when you create one
