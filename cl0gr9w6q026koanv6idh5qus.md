## Deploying a static HTML and CSS site using Github Pages

The next step after creating a website, is deploying it to make it available to the whole world. If your site is static, and doesn't use any backend then it is pretty straightforward to deploy your app. In this article, I'm gonna talk about how to deploy a static HTML and CSS site using Github Pages.

## Register at Github
First of all create an account at [Github](https://github.com). Github is a Git repository hosting service which is owned by Microsoft. It provides a great feature called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be used to deploy static sites.

## Create a Github Repository
After registering, click on the button which says **New** on the top left of the page.

## Upload files
If you know git, you're welcome to push your files to Github. Else, no worries, you can use Github's file upload feature like so:

## Enable Github Pages
Last step is to enable Github Pages like so:
1. Click on Settings

2. Click on Pages

3. Click on **Branch** and choose `master`
> This might be `main` depending on the default branch you're working on
4. Click on the button on the right of **Branch** and choose `/ (root)`
5. Click on **Save**

Then wait for some time and then refresh. Wait till you see a banner which says something like this:

And there it is! You've deployed your site using Github Pages. For example, you can view the sample deployment [here](https://kavinvalli.github.io/gh-pages-tutorial/).
